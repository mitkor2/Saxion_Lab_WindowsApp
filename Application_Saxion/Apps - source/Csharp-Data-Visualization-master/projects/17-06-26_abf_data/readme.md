# Plotting Real Data
This is nearly identical to [17-06-25_pan_and_zoom](../17-06-25_pan_and_zoom) except that this can load some real data from a CSV. It is not my goal to load electrophysiology data for this project, but in theory it would be very easy to have this program read .ATF files.

* now supports mouse wheel scrolling for additional zooming
* no longer crashes when you right-click and drag and go crazy

**CRITICAL:** [demo.csv](../../data/demo.csv) must be in the same folder as the EXE when you run it.
